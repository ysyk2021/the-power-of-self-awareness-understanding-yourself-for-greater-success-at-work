Mindfulness is also critical in developing self-awareness. It involves being present in the moment, and observing one's own thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations without judgment. By practicing mindfulness, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of their own thought patterns and habits, promoting greater self-awareness and personal growth.

Feedback
